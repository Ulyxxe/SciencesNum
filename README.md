What is the Einstein effect?

The Einstein effect, also known as gravitational redshift, happens when light or a signal changes its frequency (or color) because it’s coming out of a strong gravitational field.

Think of it like this:

    Imagine you’re trying to throw a ball straight up into the air. If gravity is strong, it’s harder to throw the ball, and it might lose some energy as it goes up.
    Light or signals work in a similar way. If they’re coming from a place where gravity is strong (like near Earth or a black hole), they lose a bit of energy, and that changes their frequency. The change in frequency is what we call the Einstein effect.

What’s the goal of your simulation?

You need to simulate how much the frequency of a signal changes in two real-life situations:
1. First situation: Galileo satellites in the wrong orbits (2018)

    In 2018, two satellites from the Galileo GPS system were accidentally put into the wrong orbits. Instead of going in perfect circles around Earth, they ended up in more stretched-out, oval-shaped orbits (called elliptical orbits).
    Because of this, the satellites were sometimes closer to Earth and sometimes farther away.
    When the satellites were closer, the gravitational field was stronger, and the frequency of the signals they sent changed more. When they were farther, the effect was weaker.
    Your job is to simulate how the frequency of the signals from these satellites changes as they move in their orbits.
    Then, you compare your simulation (what the math says should happen) with what scientists actually measured in 2018.

2. Second situation: Star S2 orbiting a black hole (2018)

    There’s a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy called Sagittarius A*. A star called S2 orbits very close to this black hole.
    When S2 gets very close to the black hole, the gravitational field is extremely strong, and the light from the star shifts a lot because of the Einstein effect.
    Scientists measured this change in 2018 when the star made its closest approach to the black hole (this is called the peribothron).
    Your job is to simulate how the frequency of light from the star changes as it orbits the black hole and compare it to what scientists measured.

Final step: Comparing the two cases

    In both cases (the satellites and the star), you’re looking at how much the frequency changes because of gravity.
    Once you’ve done the simulations for both, you compare:
        Did the theoretical predictions (the math you used in the simulation) match what scientists actually observed?
        How precise was the match? Did the Einstein effect explain the measurements accurately?

Summary

    You’re simulating how gravity affects the frequency of signals or light in two real situations:
        Satellites near Earth.
        A star near a black hole.
    You’re comparing what your math says should happen to what scientists measured in real life.
    This helps show how well Einstein’s theory of general relativity works in different parts of the universe, from Earth’s orbit to a black hole!
