# Link Between Orbits and Gravitational Redshift

This document explains how the orbits of the **Galileo satellites** and the **star S2** relate to the concept of **gravitational redshift**. The goal of this project is to simulate the orbits of these objects and show how their changing distance from a central massive object (Earth or a black hole) leads to variations in the gravitational redshift.

## Graphical Representation

The graph generated by the simulation shows the **orbital paths** of:

- **Galileo satellites** (in blue), with distances measured in kilometers.
- **Star S2** (in orange), with distances measured in hundreds of astronomical units (100 AU).

### Key Points:
1. The blue orbit appears nearly circular because the eccentricity of the Galileo satellites' orbit is relatively low.
2. The orange orbit is highly elongated, reflecting the high eccentricity of S2's orbit around the black hole.
3. The different scales of the two orbits highlight the vast difference in the environments being simulated:
   - The Galileo satellites orbit Earth, with distances in the range of tens of thousands of kilometers.
   - The star S2 orbits a black hole at distances of hundreds of billions of kilometers.

Despite these scale differences, the **gravitational redshift** occurs in both cases due to variations in the gravitational potential along the orbit.

### Link with Redshift:
1. For **Galileo satellites**, the gravitational redshift varies as they move closer to and farther from Earth in their elliptical orbits:
   - At **perigee** (closest to Earth), the gravitational potential is stronger, causing a larger redshift.
   - At **apogee** (farthest from Earth), the gravitational potential is weaker, causing a smaller redshift.

2. For **S2**, the gravitational redshift varies dramatically due to the intense gravitational field of the black hole:
   - At **peribothron** (closest approach to the black hole), the gravitational potential is extremely strong, causing a significant redshift in the light emitted by S2.
   - At **apobothron** (farthest point from the black hole), the gravitational potential is much weaker, resulting in a smaller redshift.

Thus, in both cases, the gravitational redshift depends on the changing distance from the central massive object during the orbit, demonstrating how Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity applies at vastly different scales.
