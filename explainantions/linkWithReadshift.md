# Link Between Orbits and Gravitational Redshift

This document explains how the orbits of the **Galileo satellites** and the **star S2** relate to the concept of **gravitational redshift**. The goal of this project is to simulate the orbits of these objects and show how their changing distance from a central massive object (Earth or a black hole) leads to variations in the gravitational redshift.

## 1. What is Gravitational Redshift?

Gravitational redshift is a phenomenon predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity. It occurs when light or a signal is emitted from a region with a strong gravitational field and travels to a region with a weaker gravitational field.

### How it works:
- As light escapes a strong gravitational field, it loses energy.
- This loss of energy causes a decrease in the light’s frequency, resulting in a shift toward the red end of the spectrum. Hence, the name **redshift**.

The formula for gravitational redshift is:

\[
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \frac{\Delta U}{c^2}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta f \) is the change in frequency.
- \( f \) is the original frequency.
- \( \Delta U \) is the difference in gravitational potential between two points.
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

## 2. Simulation of Gravitational Redshift

### **Experiment 1: Galileo Satellites**

#### Context:
In 2018, two Galileo satellites were launched into incorrect elliptical orbits. Unlike circular orbits, elliptical orbits bring the satellites closer to and farther from Earth during their motion.

#### Link with Redshift:
1. At **perigee** (closest point to Earth), the gravitational field is stronger, leading to a larger gravitational redshift.
2. At **apogee** (farthest point from Earth), the gravitational field is weaker, resulting in a smaller redshift.
3. The simulation calculates the gravitational redshift at both perigee and apogee using the gravitational potential formula:

   \[
   U = - \frac{GM}{r}
   \]

   where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of Earth, and \( r \) is the distance from the satellite to Earth.

4. By comparing the theoretical predictions with the real measurements from 2018, we can validate Einstein’s theory of general relativity.

### **Experiment 2: Star S2 Orbiting a Black Hole**

#### Context:
The star **S2** orbits the supermassive black hole **Sagittarius A*** at the center of our galaxy. In 2018, S2 made its closest approach to the black hole (called **peribothron**).

#### Link with Redshift:
1. When S2 is at **peribothron** (closest to the black hole), it experiences an extremely strong gravitational field, causing a significant redshift in the light it emits.
2. As S2 moves away toward **apobothron** (farthest point), the gravitational field weakens, and the redshift decreases.
3. The simulation models the orbit of S2 and calculates the gravitational redshift at both peribothron and apobothron using the same gravitational potential formula, but with the mass of the black hole.

## 3. Graphical Representation

The graph generated by the simulation shows the **orbital paths** of:

- **Galileo satellites** (in blue), with distances measured in kilometers.
- **Star S2** (in orange), with distances measured in hundreds of astronomical units (100 AU).

### Key Points:
1. The blue orbit appears nearly circular because the eccentricity of the Galileo satellites' orbit is relatively low.
2. The orange orbit is highly elongated, reflecting the high eccentricity of S2's orbit around the black hole.
3. The different scales of the two orbits highlight the vast difference in the environments being simulated:
   - The Galileo satellites orbit Earth, with distances in the range of tens of thousands of kilometers.
   - The star S2 orbits a black hole at distances of hundreds of billions of kilometers.

Despite these scale differences, the **gravitational redshift** occurs in both cases due to variations in the gravitational potential along the orbit.

## 4. How to Run the Simulation

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python einsteinEffectSimuV2.py
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Print the calculated gravitational redshift values at different points in the orbits.
   - Display graphs of the orbital paths.

## 5. Conclusion

This project shows how the **Einstein effect** (gravitational redshift) applies in two very different contexts:
- The relatively weak gravitational field of Earth affecting the Galileo satellites.
- The extremely strong gravitational field near a supermassive black hole affecting the star S2.

By simulating these cases and comparing the results with real measurements, we can demonstrate the accuracy and universality of Einstein’s theory of general relativity.
